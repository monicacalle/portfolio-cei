                        I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Web Design at CEI School (Centro de Estudios de
                        Innovación), where I’m exploring advanced responsive design strategies and crafting immersive UX
                        micro-interactions to deliver experiences that are both intuitive and delightfully engaging.

                        I completed an immersive Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy, where I mastered
                        front-end development with JavaScript (ES6+, React) and back-end engineering using Python
                        (Flask, REST APIs), building and deploying scalable, real-world web applications with
                        industry-standard tools and workflows.

                        I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Foreign Languages—focusing on English and French pedagogy—which
                        provided me with a solid foundation in linguistics, intercultural communication, and effective
                        language-teaching methodologies that continue to inform my work today.

                        As a Frontend Developer at Enerlink, I helped build their smart metering software by developing
                        a complete notification and preference system for the web app. This feature enabled users to
                        receive real-time updates and tailor their preferences directly through the interface, using
                        filters for more accurate control. I also worked on debugging legacy code and improving the
                        overall site by fixing bugs and enhancing performance.

                        In this role, I focused on supporting students throughout their learning journey, with a strong
                        emphasis on teaching JavaScript and React. My biggest challenge was adapting to the different
                        ways each student approached problems and developed solutions. This experience not only
                        strengthened my ability to explain complex concepts, but also helped me tailor my teaching
                        approach to meet each student’s individual needs.
