          HI... I’m an enthusiastic Front-End Developer with experience in
          technologies like JavaScript, React.js, and Next.js. Passionate about
          creative problem-solving and building web applications that balance
          functionality with great design. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s
          degree in Graphic Design, which enhances my ability to approach
          projects with both aesthetic and strategic insight. I’m always eager
          to learn and grow, and I thrive on challenges that push me forward. I
          strongly believe in the power of teamwork and love bringing positive
          energy and creativity to every project.
